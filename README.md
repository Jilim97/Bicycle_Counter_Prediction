## Machine Learning for Life Science Poject 1

## Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive model for number of bikes passing via Coupure Links considering various factors. 

To develop a predictive model that can accurately forecasts the number of bike various factors such as weather, date, time, and school schedule are used.

Not only 2023 bike data, but also 2022 data was collected for more precise prediction.
